<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/w5sb3pyeef64ns6/Feature.jpg?dl=1" align="center">


Infinite pew pew is a clone of Geometry Wars with new mechanics. Experience an intense gameplay, full of danger in every corner you go (or escape), that will boil your blood and augment your adrenaline with hordes of enemies while dodging bullets and surviving as long as you can on this geometric mayhem of massacre and destruction.

Features:

- 5 kinds of weapons
- Weapon upgrades
- 14 types of enemies
- Recruit Amigos (yeah, that's an actual item name in the game)
- Badass Time (a power up that slows down the game for a short period of time)
- Prepare to die a lot

Controls: 

- W,A,S,D - Move your ship
- Directional Arrows - Shooting directions
- Enter: Action Button
- ESC: Cancel Button
- Infinite pew pew also supports the xbox360 controller

Infinite pew pew is made with RIE, my own engine built with XNA, so in order to execute Infinite pew pew you have to install XNA on your windows computer. The process is different depending on your OS, so I recommend you to google it on how to do it. 

After you managed to install XNA on your OS, you will need .NET which you can get from here:

The objective of uploading the Source code of Infinite pew pew is that you, young adventurers, want to build a Game Engine or a Game from Scrath know how to do it. Hopefully this code will help you solve some bugs, or give you an idea on how to build certain module in your application. If you have any questons feel free to send me a mail to alan.sosa.mejia@gmail, I'd be glad to help you in your project.

Infinite pew pew began as a programming adventure, an education toy and as a playground where I could practice all the things related to game engines that I learned thanks to the internet. After a couple of weeks the project became more solid and so the decision to make it commercial became closer with the support of my family and friends. <br />

2 years have passed since this project has finished, I have made some revenue of it, and if you want to know more about the story visit the [Blog](http://cubitomorado.blogspot.com) that I was writing when this project was alive. I learned so much from this: Business development, Importance of distribution channels, how deadly is to code a game engine and above all, I had tons of fun even thou I was starving most of the time. So enjoy this little piece of code and I hope is useful to you. <br />
