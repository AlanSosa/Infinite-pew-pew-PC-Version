Infinite pew pew is made with RIE, my own engine built with XNA, so in order to execute Infinite pew pew you have to install XNA on your windows computer. The process is different depending on your OS, so I recommend you to google it on how to do it. 

After you managed to install XNA on your OS, you will need .NET which you can get from here:

The objective of uploading the Source code of Infinite pew pew is that you, young adventurers, want to build a Game Engine or a Game from Scrath know how to do it. Hopefully this code will help you solve some bugs, or give you an idea on how to build certain module in your application. If you have any questons feel free to send me a mail to alan.sosa.mejia@gmail, I'd be glad to help you in your project.
